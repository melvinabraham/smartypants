# Smartypants
Telegram bot that uses Cleverbot wrappers to reply intelligently. 


## Quickstart 
* Set Telegram bot token in `config.cfg`
* Add profanity words to `data/wordlist.txt`. Create the file if it doesn't exist.
* Run the poller using `python app.py`. Use `tmux` or `screen` to persist the runtime.
